# 🎓 Tips for First-Timers

### Before You Start
1. **Read the challenge carefully** – Understand the requirements before coding
2. **Start simple** – Get something working, then improve it
3. **Don't aim for perfect** – "Good enough" is the goal
4. **Ask questions early** – Don't struggle alone for days

### During Development
1. **Time-box your work** – Set a timer for 2–3 hour blocks
2. **Commit frequently** – Small commits are easier to manage
3. **Document as you go** – Write down your decisions and trade-offs
4. **Test your solution** – Even basic tests count!

### For Demo Day
1. **Practice your demo** – Run through it once before presenting
2. **Focus on learning** – Share what you learned, not just what you built
3. **Be honest** – "I tried X but it didn't work" is valuable!
4. **Have fun** – This isn't a job interview, it's a celebration

# ❓ FAQ

### Q: I'm a junior developer. Is this too advanced for me?
**A:** Not at all! This event is designed for **all levels**. You'll be paired with others, and learning is valued as much as the solution itself. Many juniors have won past challenges!

### Q: I don't know any "new" technologies. Can I still participate?
**A:** Yes! You can use familiar tech and still score well. The "new tech" category is just one part of scoring. Focus on solid fundamentals and clear communication.

### Q: What if I can't finish in time?
**A:** Partial solutions are 100% welcome! Submit what you have and explain what you would do next. You'll still learn and might still win!

### Q: What if my solution breaks during the demo?
**A:** It happens! Explain what was supposed to happen. Judges value your understanding and design decisions over a perfect demo.

### Q: How much time should I really spend?
**A:** Aim for **4–6 hours total** over 2–3 weeks. That's roughly 2 hours per week. Don't overwork—this should be fun!

### Q: Can I use code from previous projects?
**A:** You can reuse your own patterns and approaches, but the solution should be built for this specific challenge. No copy-pasting entire projects.

### Q: What languages/frameworks are allowed?
**A:** Unless the challenge specifies, use whatever you want! Want to try Rust? Go for it. Comfortable with Python? Perfect!

### Q: Do I need to use AI tools?
**A:** Nope! It's optional. If you do use them (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.), document how they helped for bonus points.

### Q: What if I have a question not listed here?
**A:** Ask in `#Vietnam Dev Community` ([https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAm0xrYkU?cls=7](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAm0xrYkU?cls=7)) or email the organizer. No question is too small!
